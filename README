Instructions

Download AutoHotKey v2 setup and run the .ahk file in the repo.
Click the "Config" tab, and set your current resolution (width and height).
Set the amount of pixels to decrement to 1 or 2.
  (You can use more if it's needed)
Tweak the millisecond amount at the bottom to where Etterna doesn't stutter heavily in gameplay.
  (3000 is a good starting point)
Click "Recheck" to save your values, then click the About tab and click "Toggle timer".

Troubleshooting

If you are having issues with external keyboards in Parallels:

    Enable ALL startup settings in the app (File -> Settings)
  Disable the Parallels Coherence Service
    Keep Tools enabled to continue using an external keyboard
  Change the VM profile in Parallels to "Games only"
    Enable "Isolate Windows from Mac" in Security
  Attempt to debloat Windows 11
    Do not use the AME toolbox, it has undefined behaviour with these tweaks
  Attempt to use Ahk2Exe to compile the .ahk file

    The .rar file is safe, and is archived from its registration-walled site on BlackBox4Windows

If you are having issues with any "Access Denied" errors in the program:
  Download NSudo and run the program with SYSTEM permissions
    This should alleviate any access errors
