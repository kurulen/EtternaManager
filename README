Troubleshooting

If you are having issues with external keyboards in Parallels:
  Disable Windows 11 dynamic tick
  Download Danskee's Memory Cleaner (https://www.majorgeeks.com/files/details/memory_cleaner_danskee.html)
    Enable ALL startup settings in the app (File -> Settings)
  Disable the Parallels Coherence Service (keep Tools enabled to continue using an external keyboard)
  Change the VM profile in Parallels to "Games only", and enable "Isolate Windows from Mac" in Security
  Attempt to debloat Windows 11 (do not use the AME toolbox, it has undefined behaviour with these tweaks)
